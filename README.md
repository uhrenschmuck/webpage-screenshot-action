# Webpage Screenshot Action

Capture a screenshot of a webpage, across Windows, Mac, and Linux.
This action also allows running some arbitrary JavaScript code on the
page before taking the screenshot (for example for navigation, DOM validation, etc.). 

Its initial purpose was to help ensure PR quality
(by  attaching a screenshot of the contributed documentation and doing some basic HTML checks), 
but there may be much more applications of this action. 

## Usage

There are many ways to use this action. 
They vary in the way the screenshot is taken and the way how it is used.

The simplest way to use the action is demonstrated in the following example:

```yaml
name: Take screenshot
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  screenshots:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: karol-brejna-i/webpage-screenshot-action@v1
        with:
          url: https://google.com
```

This workflow fires when some changes are pushed to the main branch. 
It **takes a screenshot** of the whole web page under provided URL (https://google.com) and saves it as _screenshot.png_.

Additionally, it **sets the output variable** _scriptResult_ for other steps/jobs to use.
(The value holds the URL, screenshot file name and optionally javascript code result, i.e. `[{"url":"https://google.com","result":{"screenshot":"screenshot.png"}}]`).


The behavior or the action can be modified by providing proper input parameters.
Let's discuss the configuration options first and then see some actual examples. 

### Configuration

Here are the inputs you can use to configure the action:

| Name         | Description                                                                                               | Default            |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| url          | The URL of the webpage to screenshot                                                                      | required parameter |
| output       | The output file name                                                                                      | `screenshot.png`   |

| xpath        | The XPath selector of the element to screenshot. Only used if _mode_ is 'element' or 'scrollToElement'    |                    |
| scriptBefore | JavaScript code to be executed before taking a screenshot.                                                |                    |
| width        | Viewport width                                                                                            | 800                |
| height       | Viewport height                                                                                           | 600                |


#### url
Required parameter. A fully qualified URL of the webpage to screenshot.
It can be an external web page, it can be a file from a PR, or it can be a page served by your workflow (served locally, on GitHub action runner).

#### output
The path of the output file (including the name). It can be relative to the current working directory, or absolute.
If not provided, the screenshot will be written to `./screenshot.png`.

#### mode
The operating mode for the action. Possible values are:
- `page`: takes a screenshot of the page in a browser window
- `wholePage`: takes a screenshot of the whole page( default)
- `scrollToElement`: scrolls the page to the element specified by `selector` or `xpath`
   and takes a screenshot of the page in a browser window
- `element`: takes a screenshot of the DOM element specified by `selector` or `xpath`

Please, take a look at the [examples](#examples) below for more details.

#### selector
CSS selector of an HTML page element, i.e. `#www-wikipedia-org > div.search-container` (see [CSS selector syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)). 

Only used if _mode_ is `element` or `scrollToElement`.

#### xpath
XPath selector of an HTML page element, i.e. `//*[@id="www-wikipedia-org"]/div[1]` (see [XPath syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath)).

Only used if _mode_ is `element` or `scrollToElement`.

### Examples
The [detailed examples](examples/README.md) show different aspects of the usage of the action.
- How the workflow is started
- What do we want to capture ("living" web page, a file from a PR, a page served by your workflow)
- How do we want to capture it (whole page, a specific element, a fragment of the page, etc.) 
- What do we want to do with the captured image (upload it to a PR, attach it to a release, etc.)


      Please, mind that the sole responsibility of the action is to take 
      a screenshot of a web page (or run a script for that page). 
      What is done with the screenshot is entirely up to you and should be handled by your workflow.

Here are some basic examples.

#### Full page screenshot + upload as an artifact 
The following workflow takes a whole page screenshot and uploads it as an artifact.

<img src="assets/dedicated-chrome-screenshot.png" height="420" alt="My Image" align="right" style="float:right" />

```yaml
name: Upload screenshot
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  screenshots:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: karol-brejna-i/webpage-screenshot-action@v1
        with:
          url: https://github.com/karol-brejna-i/webpage-screenshot-action/blob/main/README.md
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: simple-screenshot
          path: ${{ github.workspace }}/*.png
```

[This workflow](examples/upload_artifact.yml) is fired when some changes are pushed to the main branch, or it can be triggered manually.
It makes a whole page screenshot of the README.md file and uploads it as an artifact.
On the right side, you can see the screenshot taken by the action.


#### Take a screenshot of first table in a document
Let's assume that you want to make a screenshot of the first table in a document.

<img src="assets/element-screenshot.png" width="240" alt="My Image" align="right" style="float:right" />

```yaml
name: Element's screenshot
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  screenshots:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: karol-brejna-i/webpage-screenshot-action@v1
        with:
          url: https://github.com/karol-brejna-i/webpage-screenshot-action/blob/main/README.md
          mode: element
          xpath: //table[1]
          output: element-screenshot.png
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: simple-screenshot
          path: ${{ github.workspace }}/*.png
```

[This workflow](examples/element.yml) takes a screenshot of the first table in the README.md file and saves it in a file called `element.png`.
The element to capture is specified by the XPath selector `//table[1]`.

#### Scroll view to a specific element and take a screenshot
Let's see the difference between `scrollToElement` and `element` modes.

<img src="assets/scroll-to-element-screenshot.png" width="240" alt="My Image" align="right" style="float:right" />

```yaml
name: Screenshot from a scrolled page
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  screenshots:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: karol-brejna-i/webpage-screenshot-action@v1
        with:
          url: https://github.com/karol-brejna-i/webpage-screenshot-action/blob/main/README.md
          mode: scrollToElement
          xpath: //table[1]
          output: scroll-to-element-screenshot.png
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: simple-screenshot
          path: ${{ github.workspace }}/*.png
```

[This workflow](examples/scroll_to_element.yml) opens the README.md file,
scrolls the view to the first table (`xpath: //table[1]`) and takes a screenshot of the page.  
It saves the screenshot in a file called `element.png`.


Please, mind that for `element` mode only the specified element is captured.
In `scrollToView` the screenshot captures the viewport starting from the element (so the following elements are also included).

#### Local file screenshot
The action can also take a screenshot of a local file.
```yaml
name: Local file screenshot
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  screenshots:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: karol-brejna-i/webpage-screenshot-action@v1
        id: screenshot
        with:
          url: file://${{github.workspace}}/examples/simple.html
```

[This workflow](examples/local_file.yml) checks out the repository and takes a screenshot of one of the files in the repo (`examples/simple.html`).

Please, note how the URL is constructed. The `file://` prefix is used to specify that the file is local
and the `${{github.workspace}}` variable is used to resolve the path where git repository was checked out.
This could be any path on the machine where the action is running, as long as it constitutes a valid URL.

## To Do
The following features are not implemented yet, but may be added in the future:
1. Simulate a device (i.e.mobile phone; see https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.knowndevices/)
2. Allow for multiple screenshots (i.e. for different devices)
4. Capture the browser console output (if required) - mechanics in place, but not exposed as an input
5. Specify screenshot type (puppeteer supports either jpeg or png)
